    <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>
      The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the
      Palace')[4][5][6] is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right
      bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned
      in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb
      of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
      himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
      which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens
      bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
